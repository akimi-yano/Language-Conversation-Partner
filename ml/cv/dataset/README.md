# Dataset

For the image recognition feature, I narrowed down the scope into Food categorization, and the below link contains a dataset for categorizing food image into 11 different categories such as Bread, Dairy product, Dessert, Egg, Fried food, Meat, Noodles-Pasta, Rice, Seafood, Soup, Vegetable-Fruit. 16643 food images grouped in 11 major food categories. There are 3 splits in this dataset - evaluation, training, and validation.
